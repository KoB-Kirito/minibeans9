After Robin and Amandla defeat the primal fear of loneliness, a feeling of relief spreads. The demons have become weaker and Robin survived this external challenge.
However the battle against inner shadows and personal demons doesn’t end with a single victory. 
Defeating this monster was just one part of the journey. Robin still has to contend with the inner struggles and shadows.
These internal battles, whether they are related to self-doubt, past traumas, insecurities or any other personal issues, are often complex.
They can resurface in various shapes, and Robin will need to continue the inner work to overcome them.
With the help of Amandla, Robin continues to keep the inner shadows in bay. There are good days and bad days. Even if the darkness never completely disappeared, because it’s part of ourselves, Robin could find a way to accept it.
With self-reflection, healing, and self-acceptance, she can gradually confront and conquer her inner shadows, achieving a sense of inner peace and self-fulfillment. \
